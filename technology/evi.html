        <hr>
        <p class= "paragraph"> Electric vehicle adoption is growing exponentially. The  uptake  of  EVs  is  the  result  of  several   factors,and technological factor is one of the strongest among them.
            In addition, technology innovation would be at the core of this transition. Increasingly,there are more technological elements that are being introduced on the vehicles towardsthe improvement of both passengers and pedestrians’ safety. 
            In addition, there is a greaternumber of vehicles on the roads, which allows for us to move quickly and comfortably .
        Nowadays, we can encounter different types of EVs, according to their engines tech-nology. The tech-nology of electric vehicles can be propelled by Battery,  Pluggable external electric source , combination of a conventional internal combustion engine and an electric engine.</p>

        <p class= "paragraph"> <b><i><u> Vehicle to Grid </u></i></b> is a key area of EV charging energy management, enabling two-way energy exchange between the vehicle and the grid. 
            With V2G, energy stored in an EV can be fed back to the grid at times of peak demand to minimize the strain. This approach thus enabling them to reduce their costs of EV charging and receive other discounts
        on their electricity usage.</p>

            <p class="paragraph" > Electric cars is function by plugging into a charge point and taking electricity from the grid. They store the electricity in rechargeable batteries that power an electric motor, which turns the wheels. 
             Electric cars accelerate faster than vehicles with traditional fuel engines – so they feel lighter to drive. The battery electric cars minimize wasted energy by turning the car off when stopped (“idle-off”) and by charging the battery when braking (“regenerative braking”).
             Electric motors are also inherently more energy-efficient than gasoline or diesel engines. Electric motors generate near-instant torque, or turning-force, while the torque of internal combustion engines increases in tandem with the engine’s revolutions (RPM). 
             This means that BEVs have extremely fast acceleration and a “light” or “zippy” feel compared to conventional cars. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles have both an electric motor and a conventional gasoline or diesel engine.
             Compared to a battery electric vehicle, this extends the total driving range but lowers the all-electric range. The technology of hybrid EVs  convert hydrogen gas 
         into electricity to power an electric motor and battery.</p>

            <p class="paragraph" > Unlike a moped, the e-bike provides pedal assistance through the bottom-bracket motor, as required. It has no rider modulated throttle, which is an important distinction. ... 
             Brushless electric motors convert the battery's energy to pedalling assistance, but they do spin at a much higher rotation than your riding cadence.
             They are powered by a rechargeable battery, rather than being gas powered, as well.
             These bikes are still great for exercise, but they assist riders who need it. All electric bikes have a rechargeable battery that powers the motor. 
             However, the motor is engaged in different ways in different types of e-bikes. Electric bikes can be set up in a couple of ways in regards to how the motor is mounted and how it assists your pedaling.
         Motors are attached in two main ways. Some e-bikes’ motors are connected to the crank drive.</p>
