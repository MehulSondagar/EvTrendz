			<h2 id = "evdetails"> What is EV </h2>
			<dl class="evsum"> An EV is a shortened acronym for an electric vehicle. EVs are vehicles that are either partially or fully powered on electric power.
			Electric Vehicles uses one or more electric motors or traction motors for propulsion. An electric vehicle may be powered through a collector system by electricity from off-vehicle sources, or may be self-contained with a battery, solar panels, fuel cells or an electric generator to convert fuel to electricity. EVs include, but are not limited to, road and rail vehicles, surface and underwater vessels, electric aircraft and electric spacecraft.  </ul>

			<b>i.	Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)</b> <br><br>
		
				Powered solely by an electric battery, with no gas engine parts. Most BEVs are capable of fast charging and L2 charging. Zero emissions. Battery Electric Vehicles, also called BEVs and more frequently called EVs, are fully electric vehicles with rechargeable batteries and no gasoline engine. All energy to run the vehicle comes from the battery pack which is recharged from the grid. BEVs are zero emissions vehicles, as they do not generate any harmful tailpipe emissions or air pollution hazards caused by traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. Some popular EV models are pictured here and a full list of available fast charging EV models is available in the chart above.

			<b>ii. Plug-in Hybrid Electric vehicle (PHEVs)</b><br><br>
			Similar to a Hybrid, but with a larger battery and electric motor. Has a gas tank and a charging port. Can charge by using L2 chargers. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles, or PHEVs, have both an engine and electric motor to drive the car. Like regular hybrids, they can recharge their battery through regenerative braking. They differ from regular hybrids by having a much larger battery, and being able to plug into the grid to recharge. While regular hybrids can (at low speed) travel 1-2 miles before the gasoline engine turns on, PHEVs can go anywhere from 10-40 miles before their gas engines provide assistance. Once the all-electric range is depleted, PHEVs act as regular hybrids, and can travel several hundred miles on a tank of gasoline. All PHEVs can charge at an EVgo L2 charger, but most PHEVs are not capable of supporting fast charging.

		<b> iii. Hybrid Electric vehicle (HEVs) </b><br><br>
		Low-emission vehicles that use an electric motor to assist gas-powered engines. All energy comes from gasoline. Cannot charge with EVgo. Hybrid Electric Vehicles, or HEVs, have both a gas-powered engine and an electric motor to drive the car. All energy for the battery is gained through regenerative braking, which recoups otherwise lost energy in braking to assist the gasoline engine during acceleration. In a traditional internal combustion engine vehicle, this braking energy is normally lost as heat in the brake pads and rotors. Regular hybrids cannot plug into the grid to recharge and cannot charge with EVgo.
